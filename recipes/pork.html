        <p>Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling in the center of each wonton wrapper. Moisten edges with water and fold over to form a triangle.

        <p>Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer lined with parchment,
            making sure they're not touching to prevent them from sticking together;
